      <h1>Trees for the 3rd Grade</h1>
      <h2>Service-Learning Project Summary</h2>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Trees for the 3rd Grade is a national service-learning project to teach
        <a href="http://www.nwf.org/Trees-for-Wildlife.aspx" target="_blank"
          >The National Wildlife Federation</a
        >
        age-appropriate Trees for the 21st Century curriculum to approximately
        3.1 million U.S. third graders annually. This fun program takes an
        interdisciplinary approach to science and environmental education while
        effectively teaching kids about conservation. Learning-by-doing is a
        fantastic way for kids to internalize lessons and a major element of the
        project happens when each child is given a free sapling to plant,
        uniting all U.S. 3rd graders with the knowledge that they are doing
        their part to address global climate change. By working together with
        third graders across the nation on an Earth Day project, these kids are
        doing something big and positive to address the climate crisis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Trees for the 3rd Grade program uses a model developed by Newaygo
        County, Michigan 4-H, where high school-aged 4-H members have taught
        elementary school children about the value of trees for more than
        fifteen years. Every year approximately 1,000 students in Newaygo County
        learn about trees on Earth Day/Arbor Day/Global Youth Service Day, and
        then plant a donated tree in their town or rural area. The longevity of
        the Newaygo project is testimony to its strength as a teaching tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary goal of the project is to instill a life-long environmental
        ethic and sense of environmental stewardship in 3rd graders. Grounded
        with an understanding of the importance to their lives of trees, natural
        resources, and the need to manage resources wisely, these students will
        be better equipped to make smart choices throughout their lives. For
        example, by understanding the energy and environmental costs of everyday
        products in their lives, food, packaging, etc., this generation will
        freely adopt recycling, reuse, and reduce as a lifestyle choice. In
        addition, these children can bring these and other sustainable concepts
        into their homes and school, and influence adult behaviors.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project has a number of secondary goals. The most important goal is
        sustainability, such that teachers, school administrators, the county
        4-H Agent, 4-H or other interested high school students, and the
        Conservation Districts continue to support and implement the project
        every year. In this way, all youth in the county will cycle through the
        program, and learn and hopefully adopt environmental stewardship as a
        normal part of life. This project will give thousands of senior 4-H
        youth/high school students valuable leadership experience, public
        speaking opportunities, and the chance to experience teaching in an
        elementary school class. Given a positive experience, some of the high
        school students may consider teaching as a profession. Trees planted
        will be registered on the
        <a href="http://4hmilliontrees.org/join.php">Join Us page</a>, and count
        toward the goal of the 4-H Million Trees Project, a project intended to
        inspire millions of youth to plant trees to address issues of global
        deforestation and global climate change.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a big and valuable project, so it is time to get started. Every
        day is a good day to plant a tree, so please
