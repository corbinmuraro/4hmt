      <h1>Publicity</h1>
      <p>4HMT uses a multi-level approach to publicity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This website is the primary and most important channel to distribute
          project information.
        </li>
        <li>
          TV exposure, including Nickelodeon and Eco-Company, help get the word
          out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Online newsletters are an excellent way to publicize the project.
        </li>
        <li>
          4HMT has a
          <a

          >
            Facebook Fan Page</a
          >
          with the latest photos and videos from projects from California to
          Africa.
        </li>
        <li>
          Youth club leaders should encourage reporters at local, regional, and
          national newspapers and magazines to write articles about the project
          and its youth sponsors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Youth interested to write articles should contact 4HMT for
          <a
            href="http://localhost:8000/media/Speech%20Materials%20-%204-H%20Million%20Trees%20Project.zip"
            >templates and other materials</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          A number of terrific articles have been written about the project.
          Please Google "4-H Million Trees Project" to see a few.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to seeking local, regional, and national press coverage for
        the project, 4HMT hopes that members and leaders from clubs and units
        across the nations will place community service announcements in the
        local media outlets, including newspapers, radio stations, and
        televisions stations. Youth Corresponding Secretaries at each club, or
        members of each 4-H unit can contact us to see a sample news release
        template, and then adapt it for their purposes. Most media outlets will
        respond positively to youth e-mail or phone requests for publicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that youth members will write and publish 4HMT articles they
        have written themselves for their local 4-H newsletters and newspapers,
        and claim credit for this work in their record books. Also, any radio or
        TV appearances will be an excellent addition to the record books. As an
        example,
        <a

          The Emerald Trees Project</a
        >, a big youth founded and led 4-H reforestation effort in Mariposa
        County, California is highlighted in a TV news report.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information on this website and writers' imaginations and personal
        experiences will be very valuable to create interesting articles. Please
        <a href="http://localhost:8000/about.php#contact">contact</a> local
        adult leaders or the project if you need further help.
