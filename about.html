        The 4-H Million Trees community service project was conceived by a
        member of the Pacifica, California 4-H Club after viewing the film "An
        Inconvenient Truth."&nbsp; Originally a club project, 4HMT was upgraded
        to an international campaign by the sheer magnitude of the numbers. The
        youth members of this project in San Mateo County, CA, and youth
        participants from other clubs, schools, and youth organizations around
        the world, are managing the operations including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Building the network of 4-H clubs and units to participate in the
          project
        </li>
        <li>Creating this website</li>
        <li>Fundraising</li>
        <li>Public Relations Outreach</li>
        <li>Data Management</li>
        <li>Communications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        It is our hope that 4-H members from clubs and units across the country
        and around the world will volunteer to lead this project for their club
        or county.&nbsp; Besides the obvious reduction in greenhouse gases from
        the successful completion of this project, the youth involved will learn
        valuable life skills which are at the core of the 4-H program, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsibility</li>
        <li>Organization</li>
        <li>Management</li>
        <li>Leadership</li>
        <li>Citizenship</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This all-volunteer effort is in keeping with the 4-H Pledge which
        members recite at every meeting:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        As a true 4-Her, I pledge <br />
        my Head to clearer thinking, <br />
        my Heart to greater loyalty <br />
        my Hands to larger service, and <br />
        my Health to better living, <br />
        for my club, my community, <br />
        my country, and my world.
      </blockquote>
