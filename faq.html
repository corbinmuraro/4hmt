      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: What is the 4-H Million Trees Project?<br />
        <b>Answer</b>: 4HMT is an international service-learning project to
        inspire up to 6 million 4-H youth to plant trees in their communities to
        help slow global climate change.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: How do 4-H clubs and units join the 4-H Million Trees
        Project?<br />
        <b>Answer</b>: 4-H clubs and units in the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean,
        and around the world are invited to join 4HMT.&nbsp; Youth boards of
        directors can vote to place the tree-planting community service project
        on the general meeting agenda so the club members can vote to
        participate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: Can organizations or individuals outside of 4-H join
        4HMT?<br class="handandahalfbreak" />
        <b>Answer</b>: If groups of individuals are inspired by this project to
        get personally invested in the climate crisis, they can absolutely join
        the project and get some trees in the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: How do we organize our tree planting events?<br
          class="handandahalfbreak"
        />
        <b>Answer</b>: Establish a youth committee to plan and organize your
        tree planting events.&nbsp; For example, determine where to plant, what
        species of trees, where to obtain trees, when to plant, etc.&nbsp; Ask
        important questions such as, should we stake the new trees, do we need
        to protect trees from animals, how will we water trees and maintain
        until the roots are established.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: How do we incorporate the learning part of this
        service-learning project?<br class="handandahalfbreak" />
        <b>Answer</b>: All clubs are encouraged to incorporate a learning module
        to their tree planting events.&nbsp; 4HMT is a SET project, and it is
        hoped that youth will get turned on to environmental science, botany,
        biology, forestry, etc. through this project.&nbsp; Please check the
        Links page for some ideas on tree curricula, such as the National
        Wildlife Federation's
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nwf.org/Trees-for-Wildlife.aspx"
          >Trees for the 21st Century</a
        >, the Education Development Center's
        <a href="http://treesandponds.edc.org/">Trees Curriculum</a>, and the
        Virginia 4-H's
        <a target="_blank" href="http://sites.ext.vt.edu/virtualforest/"
          >Virtual Forest</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: How do I register for the 4-H Million Trees Project?<br />
        <b>Answer</b>: Click on the
        <a href="http://localhost:8000/join.php">registration page</a>, and
        complete the online form. Be sure to complete all required fields, and
        enter a number in the trees planned, planted, and the number of members
        fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: How do I update my database record to indicate an
        increase in trees pledged or planted?<br />
        <b>Answer</b>: On the Participants page, search for and click on your
        club/unit name. Then click "Update Unit/Club", and enter the login
        information just as you originally entered it for registration. Then
        proceed to update the data. If you have problems, please
        <a href="http://www.4hmilliontrees.org/about.php#contact">contact us</a>
        with a description of the problem and the updates you were attempting to
        make.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: How do we pay for the trees?<br />
        <b>Answer</b>: Clubs have a wide-range of ideas to pay for their tree
        planting events.&nbsp; For example, 1) use current club funds to pay for
        trees, states, soil amendment, animal protection, etc.; 2) obtain trees
        for free or at a discount from local nurseries; 3) write grant proposals
        to obtain project-specific funding; 4) volunteer to plant trees for a
        City or Landowner who pays for the trees; 5) obtain trees from a state,
        regional, or local conservation district.&nbsp; Develop a funding idea
        of your own, and let us know so we can add it to this list.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: Can the 4-H Million Trees Project help out?<br />
        <b>Answer</b>: 4HMT recently obtained some funding associated with the
        2010 SeaWorld Environmental Excellence Award and the Nickelodeon Big
        Green Grant, and can offer matching grants to 4-H clubs that absolutely
        need help with their tree planting events.&nbsp; Clubs are required to
        prepare a grant proposal following the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.4hmilliontrees.org/text/rfp.pdf"
          >Request for Proposal</a
        >
        file described on the Funding page of this website. In addition, clubs
        that are granted funding are required to prepare a final report.&nbsp;
        Please
        <a href="http://www.4hmilliontrees.org/about.php#contact">contact us</a>
        for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: Does the 4-H Million Trees Project have any
        partnerships that could help us out?<br />
        <b>Answer</b>: 4HMT has established a number of partnerships that 4-H
        clubs and units can take advantage of for their tree planting
        events.&nbsp; Contact the Refuge Manager or the Refuge Forester at a
        <b>National Wildlife Refuge</b> in your area.&nbsp; Generally the NWR
        provides the trees, and the 4-H youth volunteer to plant trees.&nbsp;
        Contact the local chapter of <b>Habitat for Humanity</b>, so 4-H youth
        can volunteer to plant trees at the finished H4H homes.&nbsp; Obtain
        bareroot saplings from
        <b> <a href="http://www.arborday.org/">The Arbor Day Foundation</a></b
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: Do I have to get trees from the Arbor Day
        Foundation?<br class="handandahalfbreak" />
        <b>Answer</b>: No, although at $1/tree, bareroot saplings from ADF
        provide 4-H clubs and units with a very inexpensive way to obtain trees.
        All clubs have discretion on the types of trees they plant, as well as
        the location of those trees.&nbsp; The most popular alternative is to
        obtain native trees from a local nursery. If you explain the project,
        most nurseries will provide trees at cost to support 4-H and the 4-H
        Million Trees Project.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: Does the Arbor Day Foundation always send out native
        trees?<br class="handandahalfbreak" />
        <b>Answer</b>: ADF sends trees based on your climatic zone, rather than
        your locality. Therefore, they may send trees that are not native to
        your area. While this is not ideal because we encourage planting native
        and locally-adapted trees, ADF provides an extremely cost-effective way
        for clubs and units to obtain trees for the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: Why have my ADF trees not arrived?<br
          class="handandahalfbreak"
        />
        <b>Answer</b>: Bareroot saplings can only be shipped during their
        dormant period. Therefore, trees ordered after the spring cut-off date
        will be send out during the following dormant season. Also, ADF will
        send trees at the appropriate time to insure the survival of the trees.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: How do I learn how to plant trees?<br
          class="handandahalfbreak"
        />
        <b>Answer</b>: Please check the links page to find some excellent
        resources on this topic, such as the SMUD shade trees video.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Question</b>: What should I do if I have questions that should be
        added to this list?<br class="handandahalfbreak" />
        <b>Answer</b> : Please
        <a href="http://www.4hmilliontrees.org/about.php#contact"
          >send us your questions</a
        >, and we'll post and answer them here so they can help all 4-Hers.
