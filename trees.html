      <h1>It's All About The Trees</h1>

      <h2>Choose the Right Trees</h2>
      <p>
        Trees selected for planting must be chosen carefully to grow well in
        each climate zone. Therefore, it is very important that each club works
        hard to identify the right trees for each location. We believe that
        planting trees that are both native to the region and locally adapted is
        the best way to ensure survival.
      </p>

      <h2>Cooperative Extension</h2>
      <p>
        4-H in the U.S. is part of the Cooperative Extension of the land grant
        university in each state. The Cooperative Extension generally has agents
        who are botanical experts and are pleased to share their knowledge,
        particularly with youth interested to learn. There is a very useful site
        where you can click your state and county to obtain contact information
        for your local 4-H leaders at
        <a
          href="https://4-h.org/about/find/"
          target="_blank"
          >http://www.4-h.org/get-involved/find-4-h-clubs-camps-programs/</a
        >. Or use the links on your state 4-H website, or contact your County
        Rep/Agent to find the Extension specialist in your county who can help.
      </p>

      <h2>County Resources</h2>
      <p>
        Many counties have master gardener programs where knowledgeable
        individuals contribute to their communities. We encourage 4-Hers seeking
        local botanical knowledge to learn about and take advantage of their
        county's master gardener program. Check your county Cooperative
        Extension website for more information.
      </p>

      <h2>Where are the Trees From?</h2>
      <p>
        Each 4-H club is responsible for sourcing trees for their tree planting
        projects. Local nurseries are a good bet to find trees that will grow
        well in your area, and they may be willing to provide trees at 
        wholesale prices for nonprofit tree planting projects. Alternatively,
        it is possible that the University Extension agent in your county has
        access to or can suggest local sources of seedlings, saplings, or young
        trees that could be transplanted into locations selected by each 4-H
        entity. This is a good way to be certain the tree species planted are
        suitable for your climate. In addition, youth can learn proper care for
        the trees from the agents.
      </p>

      <h2>Find Seeds</h2>
      <p>
        4-Hers who have the interest to propagate their own seeds can help to
        reduce costs, while extending the learning experience of the project.
        Plus, raising a tree from a seed is hugely satisfying. We highly
        recommend that individuals with a green thumb, or ones that want to try
        something new, get seeds for suitable tree species, and try their luck.
        Again, expert advice is available for the asking from agents and
        specialists at your county 4-H office, or through the Cooperative
        Extension service. For a great example, check
