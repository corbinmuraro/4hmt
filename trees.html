      <h1>It's All About The Trees</h1>

      <h2>Choose the Right Trees</h2>
      <p>
        Trees selected for planting must be chosen carefully to grow well in
        each climate zone. Therefore, it is very important that each club works
        hard to identify the right trees for each location. We believe that
        planting trees that are both native to the region and locally adapted is
        the best way to ensure survival.
      </p>

      <h2>Cooperative Extension</h2>
      <p>
        4-H in the U.S. is part of the Cooperative Extension of the land grant
        university in each state. The Cooperative Extension generally has agents
        who are botanical experts and are pleased to share their knowledge,
        particularly with youth interested to learn. There is a very useful site
        where you can click your state and county to obtain contact information
        for your local 4-H leaders at
        <a
          href="http://www.4-h.org/get-involved/find-4-h-clubs-camps-programs/"
          target="_blank"
          >http://www.4-h.org/get-involved/find-4-h-clubs-camps-programs/</a
        >. Or use the links on your state 4-H website, or contact your County
        Rep/Agent to find the Extension specialist in your county who can help.
      </p>

      <h2>County Resources</h2>
      <p>
        Many counties have master gardener programs where knowledgeable
        individuals contribute to their communities. We encourage 4-Hers seeking
        local botanical knowledge to learn about and take advantage of their
        county's master gardener program. Check your county Cooperative
        Extension website for more information.
      </p>

      <h2>Where are the Trees From?</h2>
      <p>
        With the support of Dr. Cathann Kress, Former Director, Youth
        Development, National 4-H Headquarters, 4HMT has partnered with The
        Arbor Day Foundation, one of the world's largest tree advocates and
        information sources, to allow 4-H clubs and units to become ADF members
        at a special annual rate, and obtain 12 trees to plant for this project.
        Please click on this link,
        <a href="http://arborday.org/" target="_blank">http://arborday.org</a>,
        become an Arbor Day Foundation member now, and quickly and simply
        receive a dozen trees by mail. Additional trees can be obtained from
        Arbor Day for a reasonable rate. If you live in an area where these
        trees will thrive, this can be a very cost-effective way to get your
        trees. Please note that the bareroot saplings available from ADF are
        best suited to the Midwest and Eastern regions of North America. Few
        trees native to California and other Western and Southwestern states are
        available from this source. ADF will send most trees while they are
        dormant until sometime in the spring, after which they have to wait
        again until the fall.
        <a href="http://arborday.org/" target="_blank"
          >The Arbor Day Foundation</a
        >
        website is a fantastic source of information about trees. Alternatively,
        it is possible that the University Extension agent in your county has
        access to or can suggest local sources of seedlings, saplings, or young
        trees that could be transplanted into locations selected by each 4-H
        entity. This is a good way to be certain the tree species planted are
        suitable for your climate. In addition, youth can learn proper care for
        the trees from the agents.
      </p>

      <h2>Find Seeds</h2>
      <p>
        4-Hers who have the interest to propagate their own seeds can help to
        reduce costs, while extending the learning experience of the project.
        Plus, raising a tree from a seed is hugely satisfying. We highly
        recommend that individuals with a green thumb, or ones that want to try
        something new, get seeds for suitable tree species, and try their luck.
        Again, expert advice is available for the asking from agents and
        specialists at your county 4-H office, or through the Cooperative
        Extension service. For a great example, check

          >The 4-H Oak Tree Project</a

        website, prepared by Merced County, California 4-H.
